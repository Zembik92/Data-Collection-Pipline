This README is a guide to scrape a website and return specified results. 

To build the scraper, we required the following modules, labraries and packages
* Selenium webdriver for nevigating the web pages
* Chromedriver for using Chrome as the browser
* Datetime for creating timestamps
* uuid for unique ids
* os to create folders
* json to create a json file
* time for pacing the scraper

Milestones 1
Setup the GIT environment for the project.

Milestone 2 
Choose website to scrape the data from. 

First of all we chose the Agoda website since our objective is to find hotel features and prices for a specfic destination during set dates
We decided to use Agoda to obtain our data from because the data is relevant to our personal ambitions to travel extensively.
